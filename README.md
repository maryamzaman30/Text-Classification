## Sep 2024 - Jan 2025

## Associated with University of London

## Introduction 

This midterm coursework focuses on the critical issue of fake news detection in the digital age, where misinformation can significantly impact public opinion and democratic processes. The project aims to compare the effectiveness of two machine learning models: a traditional statistical model (Logistic Regression) and a modern deep learning model (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, BiLSTM).

### Key Components:

- **Introduction**: Discusses the rise of fake news, its implications, and the necessity for effective detection methods using machine learning.
  
- **Objectives**: 
  - Evaluate performance trade-offs between the two models.
  - Identify contexts where one model may outperform the other.

- **Dataset**: Utilizes the FakeNewsNet dataset, which contains 23,197 labeled news articles (fake or real) with various attributes.

- **Evaluation Methodology**: Employs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.

- **Implementation**: 
  - Data exploration and preprocessing steps, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
  - Training and evaluation of both models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Results**: 
  - Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 80%, while the BiLSTM model reached 85%.
  - The deep learning model showed better performance in detecting fake news, particularly in precision and recall for the minority class.

- **Conclusions**: 
  - Highlights the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.
  - Suggests future research directions, including the exploration of transformer-based models and data augmentation techniques.

This project contributes valuable insights into the ongoing discourse on combating misinformation through machine learning approaches, emphasizing the importance of model selection based on specific task requirements.
